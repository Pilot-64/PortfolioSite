              I was born and raised in Stockholm, a place which I have always
              called home. In 2019 I relocated to the Czech Republic to pursue
              secondary education, where I am set to graduate in June of 2025.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
              The first time I definitively decided to pursue further education
              and a career in computer science was during a 2018 lecture on
              &quot;Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial
              Intelligence&quot; by the legendary MIT professor Max Tegmark. It
              was the first of many experiences that revealed to me the beauty
              of computational logic, programming, and its ethical and
              beneficial usage.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Following this, I furthered my knowledge by working on many
              different personal projects as well as participating courses such
              as the MIT Beaverworks RACECAR Prerequisite course.
